        <i>
            As previously said, watching movies can have a positive emotional impact. Movies can calm us down and soothe
            us.
            We reduce the stress within us by lowering worry, and even watching a movie may turn all negative thoughts
            into
            the better, as long as it is enjoyable Movies can communicate concepts, ideas and stories. They allow us to
            be
            cognitively transported to a different time or a place, and experience life through different eyes- gaining
            new
            perspectives, inspiration and understanding.
